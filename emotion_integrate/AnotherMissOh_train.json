Haeyoung1 was constantly compared to Haeyoung2, who was beautiful and good at everything, throughout their school days, which made her worried about attending the reunion. However, Haeyoung2 did not show up at the reunion, and there were various rumors about her. Meanwhile, Dokyung kept receiving calls from an caller id restriction unknown number, and he instinctively realized it was from Haeyoung2, so he ignored the calls. Dokyung despised Haeyoung2, because she disappeared on the day of the wedding and didn't respond to any contacts. Dokyung spent the whole day searching for Haeyoung2 but couldn't find her, and was shocked when he saw a post on Haeyoung2's SNS saying, I hope only good things happen from now on. Afterwards, Dokyung hears the news that Haeyoung2 is marrying Taejin. determined to seek revenge, Dokyung vows to sabotage Haeyoung2's marriage to Taejin and asks Chairman, an acquaintance, to withdraw the investment made to Taejin.

Dokyung told Haeyoung1 to leave that room, but she refused. Afterwards, feeling upset, Haeyoung1 called Dokyung, but it was Dokyung's younger brother, Hun, who mistakenly answered the call thinking it was Haeyoung2, and he got angry at Haeyoung1. Dokyung learned about this and apologized to Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 discovered that a reservation had been made at the restaurant where she was supposed to go with Taejin, but she went alone. Memories with Taejin at the restaurant overwhelmed Haeyoung1 with sadness. Later, she attended the school reunion, went to a club, and returned home. However, she lost her house key and waited for Dokyung to enter her house. Haeyoung1, who entered the house with Dokyung, started talking to him about her unfair school days when she was constantly compared to Haeyoung2 with the same name, and even about the story of breaking up on the day before the wedding. Dokyung also shared the story of the day of his wedding. Their shared pain became a great comfort to Haeyoung1. Worried about Haeyoung1 living alone, Dokyung continued to help her. While driving with Heeran after a long time, Haeyoung1 coincidentally encountered Haeyoung2, whom they spent their school days together with, as they passed by the marathon course.",

The happy memories that come to Haeyoung1's mind are the moments when Dokyung helped her, and she smiles as she reminisces. Meanwhile, Dokyung feels lonely every time Haeyoung1 comes to his mind due to his premonition ability. By chance, Haeyoung1 meets Dokyung at a restaurant and they have a meal together. Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung that she saw Haeyoung2, which surprises Dokyung. Later in the evening, Haeyoung1 buys alcohol at a convenience store and ends up meeting Sukyung. They drink together at Sukyung's house. In the meantime, Haeyoung1 encounters Jinsang, who is shocked to learn that her name is Haeyoung. Through Jinsang, Haeyoung1 learns that Dokyung is Sukyung's younger brother. Next day, the brand Haeyoung1 is in charge of at work is being renewed by a new team, led by Haeyoung2, which leaves Haeyoung1 flustered. Dokyung is troubled because of Dokyung's mom, Jiya. Haeyoung1 knows this but pretends not to, and Dokyung catches her, making her feel sorry. While Dokyung is having a meal with Haeyoung1, he says something that makes her heart flutter. Haeyoung1 feels excited in that moment. Upon witnessing Anna and Hun running and embracing each other, Sukyung and Jinsang ask Haeyoung1 if she can do the same as Anna did, and without hesitation, she runs towards Dokyung who has just arrived home. Dokyung, who already knew the situation due to his premonition ability, contemplates whether to embrace the running Haeyoung. In the end, Dokyung tightly embraces Haeyoung1 and feels each other's heartbeats.",

Before going to bed, Dokyung recalls the incident and bursts into laughter. The next day, Dokyung gives Haeyoung1 a ride in his car to the subway station on their way to work. During the ride, Haeyoung1 asks Dokyung to buy her a meal as a way to thank him for making her laugh. Unable to let go of her lingering attachment to Dokyung, Haeyoung2, when Dokyung doesn't answer her phone call, contacts Dokyung's company and leaves a memo. However, Dokyung mistakenly thinks that the memo is from Haeyoung1 and sends her a text message to meet at a steakhouse in the evening. Dokyung encounter Haeyoung2 unexpectedly at the steakhouse and becomes angry. Dokyung takes Haeyoung1 to a different restaurant. Haeyoung1 learns that Haeyoung2 is Dokyung's ex-girlfriend who was planned to marry Dokyung. Subsequently, Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 attend a company dinner, where even their colleagues show more favor towards Haeyoung2 than Haeyoung1. Dokyung also attends the dinner with his coworkers and coincidentally meets Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 there. Haeyoung1 goes home with Dokyung, and seeing this, Haeyoung2 becomes filled with sadness. Haeyoung1 gradually develops feelings for Dokyung, and Dokyung himself worries that he might be growing fond of Haeyoung1.",

Dokyung feels extremely embarrassed about this, but he takes the packed lunch and eats it with his colleagues at work. That evening, Dokyung tells Haeyoung1 that he enjoyed the lunch, and she is delighted. Jinsang, seeing that things are going well between Dokyung and Haeyoung1, advises Dokyung to stop seeing her. Dokyung ponders over Jinsang's words, realizing that he might be right. The next day, Dokyung receives an email from Haeyoung2. The email contains details about what happened the day before the wedding and a recorded file of a conversation between Dokyung and Jiya. Jinsang tries to interfere to prevent Dokyung and Haeyoung1 from getting closer, but Haeyoung1 notices his intentions. Haeyoung1 confesses her feelings to Dokyung and tells him not to meet Haeyoung2. However, Dokyung's mind is in turmoil. The next morning, upon seeing that Dokyung has checked the email, Haeyoung2 sends him a text message. Dokyung's feeling of remorse toward Haeyoung2 grows. Haeyoung1, on her way home from work, sits at the bus stop, lost in thoughts of the past, when Taejin approaches her.",

Dokyung doesn't respond and gets lost in old memories. Meanwhile, Haeyoung1 is sitting at a bus stop after work when Taejin notices her and approaches. Haeyoung1 recognizes Taejin and they exchange greetings. After their encounter, Haeyoung1 gets lost in old memories. Dokyung worries about Haeyoung1 in that state and takes care of her by her side. Taejin's mother contacts Deogi and expresses her wish for Haeyoung1 and Taejin to meet again. Later, after discussing it, Deogi and Kyungsu advise Haeyoung1 to meet Taejin again, but it's only then that Haeyoung1 finally reveals the truth about the breakup to Deogi and Kyungsu. Upon hearing this truth, Deogi and Kyungsu break down in tears. Meanwhile, Dokyung, sensing through his premonition ability that Haeyoung1 is in danger, becomes worried and sets out to find her. Dokyung eventually finds Haeyoung1 and they have a conversation before going inside the house.

Sukyung stops Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 for their argument. Sukyung and Haeyoung2 bring the intoxicated Haeyoung1 home but don't know her exact address, so they ask Dokyung to take her. Dokyung leaves intoxicated Haeyoung1 at a nearby hotel. Meanwhile, Deogi receives a phone call from Taejin's mother, and reveals the truth about the breakup between Haeyoung1 and Taejin. The next day, Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung that she plans to move out of her current house, and Dokyung feels disappointed. Sukyung eventually meets her former lover, persuaded by Jinsang, and returns home in a troubled state after getting drunk. Jinsang, too, is upset and drinks at home. Both Sukyung and Jinsang drink together to dispel their troubled minds. Taejin's mother informs Taejin that Deogi got angry, but Taejin ends up expressing his anger towards his own mother and goes to find Haeyoung1 to talk about what has happened. Haeyoung1 is shocked to hear this and returns home to tell Deogi and Kyungsu. Meanwhile, Dokyung, worried when Haeyoung1 doesn't come home, waits all night. The next day, Haeyoung1 invites Taejin to her house, and Dokyung goes to play table tennis with Haeyoung2. Dokyung meets Haeyoung2 to sort out their relationship and suggests they remain friends. After organizing his thoughts, Dokyung visits Haeyoung1's house to meet her, but instead encounters Taejin. This angers Dokyung, and he heads home. While on his way, he heard the sound of a car accident, just like before, and had an illusion. When he comes to his senses, Dokyung realizes he's back at his own house. Eventually, he visits psychiatrist Soontak, who tells him that he has identified the cause of his condition. On his way home, Dokyung meets Haeyoung1 and starts discussing Taejin, which leads to an argument. Dokyung and Haeyoung1 argue and then passionately kiss as they confirm each other's feelings.",

While waiting for Dokyung's call, Haeyoung1 receives a call from Taejin and agrees to have a meal together. Meanwhile, Soontak, the mental health counselor who was counseling Dokyung, visits him, sensing that something has happened. Soontak tells Dokyung, Dokyung, you are regretting a woman right before dying in a traffic accident in the future, and that woman is Haeyoung1. After hearing Soontak's words, Dokyung drinks alcohol with his mind occupied. On the other hand, Haeyoung1, who had promised to meet Taejin, keeps thinking about Dokyung and cancels the appointment. She meets Heeran and talks about the kiss with Dokyung. Heeran advises Haeyoung1 to wait, as Dokyung needs time to sort out his thoughts due to his personality. Unable to resist her feelings, Haeyoung1 visits Dokyung's house but returns in embarrassment. Hun, Dokyung's younger brother, shares a movie scenario he wrote with Anna and gains confidence. He hands it over to Heeran. Dokyung sees Heeran getting upset while reading Hun's scenario and gets into an argument with Hun at home regarding the movie scenario. Meanwhile, Sukyung feels embarrassed whenever she sees Jinsang and regrets what happened in the past. Dokyung leaves home and reminisces about old memories with his father. With his thoughts sorted out, Dokyung calls Haeyoung1 and suggests meeting up, expressing that he misses her. Haeyoung1 receives Dokyung's call and immediately heads out to meet him. Dokyung and Haeyoung1 meet and go to the seaside together, enjoying drinks and engaging in conversation at a restaurant near the beach. Later, as both of them become intoxicated, Haeyoung1 hints at staying at a motel, but Dokyung doesn't give in and takes Haeyoung1 home.",

After Dokyung knows that Haeyoung1 had made an appointment with Taejin, Dokyung asks Haeyoung1 to meet him first. Taejin, who had prepared flowers and gifts, was about to leave after giving those to Haeyoung1, but she saw Dokyung. Taejin approaches Dokyung, punches her, and asks, Did you ruin me on purpose because you like Haeyoung1? Taejin tells Haeyoung1 that the reason he failed was because of Dokyung. Haeyoung1 is shocked, thinking that all of this happened because of her Haeyoung2. Afterwards, Haeyoung1 visits Haeyoung2 and expresses her anger to Haeyoung2 for turning her life upside down. Heeran cries and apologizes to Haeyoung1 because she feels like the thing happened because of her. Jinsang and his colleagues go on a trip to the beach together to help Dokyung, who can't get his mind together. Haeyoung2 doesn't know why Haeyoung1 is angry at him. Haeyoung1 tells Deogi that she is Haeyoung2's scapegoat. Heeran meets with Hun to discuss the script Hun wrote and also talks about what Dokyung did. Dokyung sends Haeyoung1 a text message saying he's sorry. Haeyoung1 walks around her street dressed in different colors for a change. Dokyung goes to Haeyoung1 and says she is sorry, but Haeyoung1 doesn't like Dokyung who keeps saying sorry. Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung to kneel, but he just leaves. While having a meal with Haeyoung2 and the Chairman, Taejin came by and asked the Chairman if he withdrew his investment because of Dokyung. Haeyoung2 listens to Taejin and realizes the reason why Haeyoung1 was angry at her. Afterwards, Haeyoung2 goes to see Dokyung and tells him that she is grateful for thinking of her and that she loves him, but Dokyung leaves. Taejin also recalls what the Chairman and Haeyoung1 said and realizes that what Dokyung did was because of Haeyoung2. Dokyung learns that he will have a car accident in the future. Afterwards, Dokyung visits Soontack and tells him that he thinks it is right for things to end like this with Haeyoung1.",

Haeyoung1 anonymously consults on the radio and curses Haeyoung2 and Dokyung, but accidentally mentions her real name. This incident spread online, and the real name even appeared in real-time Internet search terms. Jinsang asks Dokyung if he called Haeyoung1. Dokyung seemed unwilling to call Haeyoung1, but Jinsang persuaded Dokyung. Dokyung gathers courage and goes to Haeyoung1's house. At the same time, Haeyoung1 looks at her phone hoping to see a call from Dokyung, but turns off the phone when she sees no record. At the same time, Dokyung calls Haeyoung1, but Haeyoung1's phone is already turned off. Sukyung falls off her seat while dozing off on the bus and is embarrassed, and Jinsang looks surprised. Sukyung, who got off the bus with Jinsang, said that Jinsang looked at Sukyung in amazement as she fell. Sukyung fainted while arguing with Jinsang. The hospital test results reveal that Sukyung is pregnant, and Jinsang congratulates Sukyung on her pregnancy. Sukyung despairs as he remembers his night with Jinsang. Haeyoung1 goes to Dokyung and confesses her feelings, but Dokyung pushes Haeyoung1 out of guilt. The Chairman's daughter hurled harsh words at Jiya, and Dokyung, who was watching, shouted at the Chairman's daughter to apologize to Jiya. Her wedding is ruined and Jiya blames it on Dokyung, but Dokyung gets angry at Jiya, saying he hated her mom revealing her money and not her mom having no money. Dokyung sees a future where he is reminded of Haeyoung1 even when he gets into a car accident and is on the verge of death. Dokyung then calls Soontak and says something that hints at his confidence in Haeyoung1.",

Haeyoung1 apologizes to Dokyung for being surprised, but Dokyung says he is touched and that he is okay. As Dokyung goes to the company to see Haeyoung1 with a bouquet of flowers, he runs into Haeyoung2 by chance. Haeyoung2 congratulates Dokyung on the relationship between Dokyung and Haeyoung1. Dokyung secretly left a bouquet of flowers on Haeyoung1's desk. Haeyoung1 is happy to know that fact. The Chairman provokes Taejin by asking if taking away the building is revenge. Dokyung's company is subject to a seizure ticket. Jinsang apologizes to Dokyung, saying it was his fault, but Dokyung says that if Jinsang had not encouraged him, he would not have met Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 buys Haeyoung2 a meal and reconciles. Jiya beats Haeyoung2, accusing him of ruining Dokyung's company. Haeyoung1 tells Jiya that Jiya misunderstood and that I'm the person Jiya is looking for. Jiya tells Haeyoung1 that if it's for Dokyung's sake, she should go back to Taejin. Before entering the house, Sukyung sees Jinsang smoking a cigarette and, knowing that Jinsang is having a hard time, decides to let him go. Sukyung told Jinsang something hinting at a breakup, and Jinsang cried, saying he was sorry to Sukyung. Haeyoung1 conveys her true love for Dokyung to Taejin and asks him not to hit Dokyung. Dokyung goes to see Haeyoung1, who is working overtime, with priority and waits for Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 enters the back door of the company without Dokyung knowing and meets Dokyung calmly. Haeyoung1 and Dokyung each walk with an umbrella, and then Dokyung hands his umbrella to a passerby, and Haeyoung1 and Dokyung share an umbrella with each other. Dokyung tells Haeyoung1 that he loves her and they walk together.",

Dokyung informs Haeyoung1 that he is going to propose to Haeyoung1. Taejin lets Dokyung get his studio back. Jiya gets angry at the Chairman and threatens that she will be mad if he causes trouble for Dokyung in the future. Haeyoung1 cried and said that she wanted to live with Dokyung, and Deogi felt sorry for Haeyoung1. Dokyung is confronted by Deogi and Kyungsu. Dokyung gets down on his knees and asks Deogi and Kyungsu to allow to marry Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1's parents allow Haeyoung1 and Dokyung to marry. With Anna's help, Hun meets the director, submits his script, and is happy that the day to make his dream come true has come. Haeyoung1 is surprised to learn that Sukyung and Jinsang are dating and that Sukyung is pregnant. At the reunion, Jiya is dissatisfied with Haeyoung1 and Dokyung's premarital cohabitation, but when the news of Sukyung's pregnancy is announced, Jiya remains silent. Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 have a drinking party, and although Haeyoung2 cannot go to Haeyoung1 and Dokyung's wedding, she sincerely congratulates her on Haeyoung1's marriage. Dokyung, who was waiting for Haeyoung1 to propose, gets hit by a car. Everyone is waiting in front of the operating room, hoping that Dokyung will ignore them. Meanwhile, Deogi calmly suggests that they should set a date for the wedding, and Jiya agrees with her. Haeyoung1 found this situation rather reassuring and comforting. In the end, the two get married with everyone congratulating them.",

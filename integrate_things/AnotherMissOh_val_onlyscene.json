    "episode_sum": "Heeran goes for a drive with Haeyoung1, who is having a hard time. Haeyoung1 laments her current situation, and Heeran offers words of comfort to Haeyoung1. Dokyung visits Haeyoung1 and confesses his feelings, asking for his forgiveness, but Haeyoung1 is determined and rejects Dokyung. Haeyoung1 proudly goes to work and her colleagues are puzzled by his appearance. Haeyoung1 acts calm towards these colleagues. Haeyoung1 is puzzled by Sukyung's unusual appearance, wearing heelless shoes and eating snacks. Haeyoung1 confessed to Haeyoung2 that she had made up her mind about Dokyung, and Haeyoung2 was saddened by these words. Dokyung catches Haeyoung1 differently from the future he saw. Although Dokyung turned around and couldn't see it, unlike the future that Dokyung saw, Haeyoung1 does not answer Taejin's phone call. Haeyoung1 says they should break up with Taejin during a meal, but Taejin says they should meet up a little more and then break up. Taejin visits Dokyung's office and gives him a sarcastic warning. When Dokyung happened to run into Haeyoung1 while walking down the street, he started talking to Haeyoung1, and Haeyoung1 turned away, telling him not to pretend to know. Unlike the future he saw, Dokyung mentioned Haeyoung1's uncomfortable shoes, and although Dokyung turned around and couldn't see it, unlike the future Dokyung saw, Haeyoung1 and Taejin do not hold hands. Haeyoung1 purposely wears uncomfortable shoes to forget about Dokyung, and while she is in pain, she does not take medicine and collapses. Haeyoung1 wakes up in the emergency room and accidentally meets Dokyung. Unlike the future he saw, Dokyung expressed his sincere apology and honest confession to Haeyoung1 and left the hospital. Haeyoung1 chases Dokyung crying and Haeyoung1 and Dokyung kiss.",

Jinsang tells Sukyung about the good dream he had yesterday, and Sukyung senses that the dream was a prenatal dream. Jinsang fails to realize that he is the father of Sukyung's baby, which frustrates Sukyung. Sukyung, who makes eye contact with Haeyoung1 as he gets out of Dokyung's car, asks them not to ever separate from each other in the future. Haeyoung2 congratulates Haeyoung1 and turns around. Dokyung has to cancel his appointment with Haeyoung1 due to a business trip and is discouraged. Dokyung decides to kidnap Haeyoung1 with the help of his colleagues. Dokyung's colleagues pretend to be police officers and take Haeyoung1 from work. Haeyoung1, who met Dokyung like that, smiles. Haeyoung1's colleagues, worried about Haeyoung1, call the police, and Deogi collapses when the police tell her that Haeyoung1 has been kidnapped. While Haeyoung1 and Dokyung were spending time alone, the police found them and they were all called to the police station. Dokyung bows his head and apologizes to Haeyoung1's parents. Jinsang buys chicken for Sukyung and visits her, and because of what Sukyung said, Jinsang realizes that he is the father of Sukyung's baby and screams. Haeyoung1 meets Taejin and announces her breakup, revealing her commitment to love with Dokyung. Haeyoung2 runs into Dokyung and pretends to be calm, but Haeyoung2, who still has feelings for Dokyung, collapses and bursts into tears. Dokyung is devastated to see that the future of his death has not changed, but Haeyoung1 does not know that and is just happy.",

Dokyung remembers a consultation where Soontak's senior doctor asked him why he was worried when he knew the exact emotions Dokyung felt at the time of death. Jinsang becomes frustrated as he imagines his future life after marrying Sukyung. Hun makes fun of Jinsang. Sukyung says to Jinsang that she will give a day to think about kissing. Dokyung sent a thank you text to Haeyoung2, and at that time, Haeyoung2 was on a blind date. Haeyoung2 looked at the text message and felt emotionally shaken for a moment, but then made up his mind and turned off the phone. Haeyoung1 says he will receive a bouquet at her cousin Seohee's wedding. Deogi objects to bringing Dokyung to Seohee's wedding. Haeyoung2 returns a love letter to Haeyoung1 that was mistakenly addressed to her when she was in high school, and she confesses that she kept it with the intention of returning it when she could confess that he was jealous of Haeyoung1. Dokyung calls Haeyoung1, who is crying due to a fight with her parents, and Dokyung tells Haeyoung1, who is crying, not to cry. Dokyung asks Taejin for forgiveness, but he ends up getting beaten up by Taejin. The injured Dokyung receives a call from Haeyoung1 while sitting on the street. Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung on the phone that he misses him, and Dokyung goes to see Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 bursts into tears upon seeing the injured Dokyung.",

    "episode_sum": "Dokyung, who has been missing Haeyoung1 since the morning, tells Haeyoung1 that he is going to pick her up and leaves the house, but Haeyoung1, who had secretly arrived in advance, surprises Dokyung. Haeyoung1 apologizes to Dokyung for being surprised, but Dokyung says he is touched and that he is okay. As Dokyung goes to the company to see Haeyoung1 with a bouquet of flowers, he runs into Haeyoung2 by chance. Haeyoung2 congratulates Dokyung on the relationship between Dokyung and Haeyoung1. Dokyung secretly left a bouquet of flowers on Haeyoung1's desk. Haeyoung1 is happy to know that fact. The Chairman provokes Taejin by asking if taking away the building is revenge. Dokyung's company is subject to a seizure ticket. Jinsang apologizes to Dokyung, saying it was his fault, but Dokyung says that if Jinsang had not encouraged him, he would not have met Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 buys Haeyoung2 a meal and reconciles. Jiya beats Haeyoung2, accusing him of ruining Dokyung's company. Haeyoung1 tells Jiya that Jiya misunderstood and that I'm the person Jiya is looking for. Jiya tells Haeyoung1 that if it's for Dokyung's sake, she should go back to Taejin. Before entering the house, Sukyung sees Jinsang smoking a cigarette and, knowing that Jinsang is having a hard time, decides to let him go. Sukyung told Jinsang something hinting at a breakup, and Jinsang cried, saying he was sorry to Sukyung. Haeyoung1 conveys her true love for Dokyung to Taejin and asks him not to hit Dokyung. Dokyung goes to see Haeyoung1, who is working overtime, with priority and waits for Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 enters the back door of the company without Dokyung knowing and meets Dokyung calmly. Haeyoung1 and Dokyung each walk with an umbrella, and then Dokyung hands his umbrella to a passerby, and Haeyoung1 and Dokyung share an umbrella with each other. Dokyung tells Haeyoung1 that he loves her and they walk together.",

Jiya calls Sukyung and says it's strange that Dokyung, who doesn't get angry like this, is sick. Dokyung hosted a dinner with his family and Haeyoung1. Sukyung and Haeyoung1 exchange jokes at dinner. Dokyung gives Haeyoung1 a bracelet. Haeyoung1 is scared and anxious because Dokyung is being too nice to her. Meanwhile, Jinsang is spending time with the girls at the club. Hun comes to Jinsang and says that Sukyung still loves Jinsang. Jinsang's heart becomes heavy when he sees melons that Sukyung likes. Dokyung stumbles upon Taejin staggering around drunk. The moment Taejin is in danger on the overpass, Dokyung saves Taejin. Haeyoung2 asks the Chairman to help Dokyung with his work, but the Chairman coldly refuses. Jinsang goes to Sukyung's company and criticizes her for not answering the phone, but Sukyung tries to ignore Jinsang. Jinsang is embarrassed that Sukyung turns away from him, but he ends up kissing Sukyung. Dokyung senses that the moment of his death is approaching and decides to honestly tell Haeyoung1 what has happened to him. Dokyung tells Haeyoung1 the truth about what happened, and Haeyoung1 says that she trusts Dokyung and they kiss. Deogi and Kyungsu eat together with Haeyoung1 and Dokyung. Deogi puts the side dishes on Dokyung's rice. Kyungsu, Dokyung, and Haeyoung1 are surprised that Deogi acknowledged Dokyung. When Taejin realizes that he was stabbed in the back by Chansu, he goes to see Chansu and beat him. Dokyung suggests that Haeyoung1 go on a trip, but Haeyoung1 becomes anxious recalling past events. Meanwhile, Taejin sends Haeyoung1 a text message apologizing, and Haeyoung1 runs toward Dokyung because he is worried about him. Taejin races after Dokyung in his car, gets out of the car, and pauses when he sees Dokyung's shoes. When Taejin finds himself intoxicated, he realizes that it was Dokyung who saved him on the overpass and turns around. Haeyoung1 and Dokyung run to each other, hug and kiss.",

Dokyung informs Haeyoung1 that he is going to propose to Haeyoung1. Taejin lets Dokyung get his studio back. Jiya gets angry at the Chairman and threatens that she will be mad if he causes trouble for Dokyung in the future. Haeyoung1 cried and said that she wanted to live with Dokyung, and Deogi felt sorry for Haeyoung1. Dokyung is confronted by Deogi and Kyungsu. Dokyung gets down on his knees and asks Deogi and Kyungsu to allow to marry Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1's parents allow Haeyoung1 and Dokyung to marry. With Anna's help, Hun meets the director, submits his script, and is happy that the day to make his dream come true has come. Haeyoung1 is surprised to learn that Sukyung and Jinsang are dating and that Sukyung is pregnant. At the reunion, Jiya is dissatisfied with Haeyoung1 and Dokyung's premarital cohabitation, but when the news of Sukyung's pregnancy is announced, Jiya remains silent. Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 have a drinking party, and although Haeyoung2 cannot go to Haeyoung1 and Dokyung's wedding, she sincerely congratulates her on Haeyoung1's marriage. Dokyung, who was waiting for Haeyoung1 to propose, gets hit by a car. Everyone is waiting in front of the operating room, hoping that Dokyung will ignore them. Meanwhile, Deogi calmly suggests that they should set a date for the wedding, and Jiya agrees with her. Haeyoung1 found this situation rather reassuring and comforting. In the end, the two get married with everyone congratulating them.",

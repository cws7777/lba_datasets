Dokyung told Haeyoung1 to leave that room, but she refused. Afterwards, feeling upset, Haeyoung1 called Dokyung, but it was Dokyung's younger brother, Hun, who mistakenly answered the call thinking it was Haeyoung2, and he got angry at Haeyoung1. Dokyung learned about this and apologized to Haeyoung1. Haeyoung1 discovered that a reservation had been made at the restaurant where she was supposed to go with Taejin, but she went alone. Memories with Taejin at the restaurant overwhelmed Haeyoung1 with sadness. Later, she attended the school reunion, went to a club, and returned home. However, she lost her house key and waited for Dokyung to enter her house. Haeyoung1, who entered the house with Dokyung, started talking to him about her unfair school days when she was constantly compared to Haeyoung2 with the same name, and even about the story of breaking up on the day before the wedding. Dokyung also shared the story of the day of his wedding. Their shared pain became a great comfort to Haeyoung1. Worried about Haeyoung1 living alone, Dokyung continued to help her. While driving with Heeran after a long time, Haeyoung1 coincidentally encountered Haeyoung2, whom they spent their school days together with, as they passed by the marathon course.",

The happy memories that come to Haeyoung1's mind are the moments when Dokyung helped her, and she smiles as she reminisces. Meanwhile, Dokyung feels lonely every time Haeyoung1 comes to his mind due to his premonition ability. By chance, Haeyoung1 meets Dokyung at a restaurant and they have a meal together. Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung that she saw Haeyoung2, which surprises Dokyung. Later in the evening, Haeyoung1 buys alcohol at a convenience store and ends up meeting Sukyung. They drink together at Sukyung's house. In the meantime, Haeyoung1 encounters Jinsang, who is shocked to learn that her name is Haeyoung. Through Jinsang, Haeyoung1 learns that Dokyung is Sukyung's younger brother. Next day, the brand Haeyoung1 is in charge of at work is being renewed by a new team, led by Haeyoung2, which leaves Haeyoung1 flustered. Dokyung is troubled because of Dokyung's mom, Jiya. Haeyoung1 knows this but pretends not to, and Dokyung catches her, making her feel sorry. While Dokyung is having a meal with Haeyoung1, he says something that makes her heart flutter. Haeyoung1 feels excited in that moment. Upon witnessing Anna and Hun running and embracing each other, Sukyung and Jinsang ask Haeyoung1 if she can do the same as Anna did, and without hesitation, she runs towards Dokyung who has just arrived home. Dokyung, who already knew the situation due to his premonition ability, contemplates whether to embrace the running Haeyoung. In the end, Dokyung tightly embraces Haeyoung1 and feels each other's heartbeats.",

Later, after discussing it, Deogi and Kyungsu advise Haeyoung1 to meet Taejin again, but it's only then that Haeyoung1 finally reveals the truth about the breakup to Deogi and Kyungsu. Upon hearing this truth, Deogi and Kyungsu break down in tears. Meanwhile, Dokyung, sensing through his premonition ability that Haeyoung1 is in danger, becomes worried and sets out to find her. Dokyung eventually finds Haeyoung1 and they have a conversation before going inside the house.

During the dinner gathering that evening, Haeyoung1 takes the opportunity to express her grievances and confront Haeyoung2 about past injustices. Sukyung stops Haeyoung1 and Haeyoung2 for their argument. Sukyung and Haeyoung2 bring the intoxicated Haeyoung1 home but don't know her exact address, so they ask Dokyung to take her. Dokyung leaves intoxicated Haeyoung1 at a nearby hotel. Meanwhile, Deogi receives a phone call from Taejin's mother, and reveals the truth about the breakup between Haeyoung1 and Taejin. The next day, Haeyoung1 tells Dokyung that she plans to move out of her current house, and Dokyung feels disappointed. Sukyung eventually meets her former lover, persuaded by Jinsang, and returns home in a troubled state after getting drunk. Jinsang, too, is upset and drinks at home. Both Sukyung and Jinsang drink together to dispel their troubled minds. Taejin's mother informs Taejin that Deogi got angry, but Taejin ends up expressing his anger towards his own mother and goes to find Haeyoung1 to talk about what has happened. Haeyoung1 is shocked to hear this and returns home to tell Deogi and Kyungsu. Meanwhile, Dokyung, worried when Haeyoung1 doesn't come home, waits all night. The next day, Haeyoung1 invites Taejin to her house, and Dokyung goes to play table tennis with Haeyoung2. Dokyung meets Haeyoung2 to sort out their relationship and suggests they remain friends. After organizing his thoughts, Dokyung visits Haeyoung1's house to meet her, but instead encounters Taejin. This angers Dokyung, and he heads home.

While waiting for Dokyung's call, Haeyoung1 receives a call from Taejin and agrees to have a meal together. Meanwhile, Soontak, the mental health counselor who was counseling Dokyung, visits him, sensing that something has happened. Soontak tells Dokyung, Dokyung, you are regretting a woman right before dying in a traffic accident in the future, and that woman is Haeyoung1. After hearing Soontak's words, Dokyung drinks alcohol with his mind occupied. On the other hand, Haeyoung1, who had promised to meet Taejin, keeps thinking about Dokyung and cancels the appointment. She meets Heeran and talks about the kiss with Dokyung. Heeran advises Haeyoung1 to wait, as Dokyung needs time to sort out his thoughts due to his personality. Unable to resist her feelings, Haeyoung1 visits Dokyung's house but returns in embarrassment. Hun, Dokyung's younger brother, shares a movie scenario he wrote with Anna and gains confidence. He hands it over to Heeran. Dokyung sees Heeran getting upset while reading Hun's scenario and gets into an argument with Hun at home regarding the movie scenario. Meanwhile, Sukyung feels embarrassed whenever she sees Jinsang and regrets what happened in the past. Dokyung leaves home and reminisces about old memories with his father. With his thoughts sorted out, Dokyung calls Haeyoung1 and suggests meeting up, expressing that he misses her. Haeyoung1 receives Dokyung's call and immediately heads out to meet him. Dokyung and Haeyoung1 meet and go to the seaside together, enjoying drinks and engaging in conversation at a restaurant near the beach. Later, as both of them become intoxicated, Haeyoung1 hints at staying at a motel, but Dokyung doesn't give in and takes Haeyoung1 home.",

Haeyoung2 learns from her coworkers that Taejin is the person who was going to marry Haeyoung1. When Taejin can't see Haeyoung1 at her company, he texts her and makes an appointment. After Dokyung knows that Haeyoung1 had made an appointment with Taejin, Dokyung asks Haeyoung1 to meet him first. Taejin, who had prepared flowers and gifts, was about to leave after giving those to Haeyoung1, but she saw Dokyung. Taejin approaches Dokyung, punches her, and asks, Did you ruin me on purpose because you like Haeyoung1? Taejin tells Haeyoung1 that the reason he failed was because of Dokyung. Haeyoung1 is shocked, thinking that all of this happened because of her Haeyoung2. Afterwards, Haeyoung1 visits Haeyoung2 and expresses her anger to Haeyoung2 for turning her life upside down.
